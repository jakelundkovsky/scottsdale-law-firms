Hey, I'm Jake. Currently building wealth management tech at Range. Before this, I spent 3 years at AppSumo where I ran A/B tests and shipped features that boosted revenue by millions annually.

I studied CS at Georgia Tech and have worked on everything from e-commerce platforms to Alexa automation at Amazon. These days, I split my time between engineering, running Scottsdale Law Firms, and diving into new side projects.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me watching sports, traveling somewhere new, or hanging outside. Big fan of good books, live music, and building cool stuff that actually helps people.
