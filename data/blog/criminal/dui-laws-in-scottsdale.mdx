If you've been charged with a DUI in Scottsdale, you're likely feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what comes next. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about DUI laws in Scottsdale and help you understand your options.

## Understanding DUI Laws in Scottsdale

In Scottsdale, driving under the influence encompasses more than just alcohol consumption. You can face DUI charges if you're in physical control of a vehicle while intoxicated in several ways. The most common is having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08% or higher, but you can also be charged if you're under the influence of any drug or if you're impaired to even the slightest degree by alcohol or drugs.

The law is particularly strict for certain categories of drivers. Commercial drivers must maintain a BAC under 0.04%, half the limit for regular drivers. For young drivers under 21, Arizona enforces a strict "zero-tolerance" policy â€“ even the smallest detectable amount of alcohol can result in a DUI charge.

## Types of DUI Charges in Scottsdale

Scottsdale recognizes several types of DUI offenses, each carrying different penalties:

**Standard DUI**: BAC of 0.08% to 0.149%
- First offense: 10 days jail (9 suspended with alcohol screening)
- Fines and fees: approximately $1,500
- License suspension: 90 days
- Mandatory ignition interlock device

**Extreme DUI**: BAC of 0.15% to 0.199%
- First offense: 30 days jail (20 suspended with alcohol screening)
- Fines and fees: approximately $2,500
- License suspension: 90 days
- Mandatory ignition interlock device

**Super Extreme DUI**: BAC of 0.20% or higher
- First offense: 45 days jail (30 suspended with alcohol screening)
- Fines and fees: approximately $3,250
- License suspension: 90 days
- Mandatory ignition interlock device

**Drug DUI**: Applies to illegal drugs, prescription medications, and even over-the-counter medications that impair driving.

**Aggravated DUI**: A felony charge that applies when:
- Driving on a suspended license
- Third DUI in 7 years
- DUI with a child under 15 in the vehicle
- DUI while required to have an ignition interlock device

## What Happens After a DUI Arrest

A DUI arrest in Scottsdale follows a specific sequence of events. It begins with the initial traffic stop, where an officer must have reasonable suspicion to pull you over. During this interaction, they'll assess you for signs of impairment and may ask you to perform field sobriety tests.

If the officer believes you're impaired, they'll place you under arrest and transport you for chemical testing. At this point, your license will be automatically suspended for 90 days if you either refuse the chemical test (which results in a longer 1-year suspension) or test over the legal limit.

Following the arrest, you'll go through the booking process, which includes being photographed and fingerprinted. You may spend some time in jail until you're released. The court process begins after this, involving multiple court appearances where having an experienced criminal defense attorney by your side is crucial for navigating the legal system effectively.

## Your Rights During a DUI Stop

Understanding your rights during a DUI stop is crucial for protecting your interests. While you must provide your license, registration, and insurance information when requested, you have the constitutional right to remain silent beyond these basic details. You can also decline to perform field sobriety tests, though this decision may have consequences.

Before any chemical tests are administered, you have the right to contact an attorney for advice. You're also entitled to seek independent blood testing to verify the accuracy of the official results. However, it's important to understand that Arizona's implied consent law means refusing a chemical test will result in an automatic license suspension, regardless of whether you're ultimately convicted of DUI.

## Long-term Consequences
